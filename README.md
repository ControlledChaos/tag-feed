**Please note:**

* It can take some time for the first few posts to appear in the tag feed URL in your web browser and normally takes longer to feed through to RSS readers like Google Reader.
* So if your posts don’t appear in the tag feed when first published check again in an hour.
* The tag feed displays feed from public sites only.  Posts from privates sites aren’t displayed.
